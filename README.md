# Insurance Fraud Detection: A Machine Learning Model to identify cases automatically

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent model for insurance fraud detection. Using historical claims that have already been marked as fraudulent or legitimate, a system will be created that is able to automatically identify suspicious patterns, thus efficiently optimizing fraud detection.

## Tools
### Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikitlearn

## Data Source
Randomly generated dataset (damage_report_DE.csv / damage_report_EN.csv)
